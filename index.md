Kelly Quinn (KQ) is a phd student in sociology at UC Berkeley researching labor markets and domestic outsourcing. KQ is also currently writing two papers (with Laura Martinez, Katerine Perez, and Daniel Schneider) on the effects of parents' unstable and unpredictable scheduling on their children as part of the [Shift Project](https://shift.hks.harvard.edu/).

In their free time, they enjoy rock climbing, playing softball, and the TV show Survivor (greatest social experiment of all time!).
